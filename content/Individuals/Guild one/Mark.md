The second founding member of guild one, and CROW's right hand man. Mark is known for their light heart and unique fighting style. You won't think they're taking you seriously until you engage in hand to hands combat with em'.

### Style
Fashion wise he's nothing special, but there's no one to equate him to in terms of fighting style. The style itself can be guessed by the spirals around their body that would indicate a heavy use of magic. The actual meat of the movements consists of a breakdance like evasion that includes a rapid dishing of magical and physical attacks, all boosted by the mechanics of their suit. Their place on an expedition lies in recon and crowd control, with their loud voice and rapid attacks. Against a single strong target it's not often that they think ahead, opting more for reacting to an enemy before it can change it's plans. 

The magical portion focuses highly on enhancement spells, but at range raw magic can be channeled into bolts using their suit. Their special moves also all contain a magical element, and are as follows

Press: Mark utilizes their high speed and large arms to grab and compress an enemy's chest (There have been instances where other weak points are targeted, but the torso or head are most common). After acquisition of the target he uses raw magic to further compress the victim. The finale of this move can either be a brutal demise, or an unconscious capture. 

Fireworks: by overloading bolts into his barrel, He's able to release them all at once into a cascading cluster of sparkles and magic! Every particle of this attack is superheated, and can sear even the toughest metals. The short lived nature of the sparks mean they cause minimal collateral and can hardly even start a fire. The result of this move can range anywhere from high destruction, to a flare, to something like a blinding flash when used in some areas.
