First chapter/issue/volume whatever will start on Guild Curse (really gotta work on that naming) WIHTOUT Pi (sad) but the idea is that I develop joogie and lute some before I introduce the third and probably most important role to the party as caretaker. 

And I was thinking as a break between THEIR comics I could switch to GO, and then after GO it could be the roleplay storyline and it would kinda cycle like that.
