lightbulb: Introductory thing to lute's curse, have him die somehow
joogie reacts to lute's death calmly calling a buddy, ideally would catch first timers off guard
To lute's pov, introduce limbo. section of his plot is just him interacting with limbo. Simultaneously corvus (mysterious friend in this comic) goes out to search for lute
Proceed to show an interaction with the accountant, 
leave their design ambiguous, but include a motif on the desk that becomes relevant later. 
ideally framed with lute being small tiny miniscule what not. Show he's not got power here.
In this case it'll probably be framed like peanuts with the big guys head out of frame.
