Whirligig began as a conventional terrestrial planet, small lifeforms and flora thrived under a binary star system. Evolution hadn't brought about truly conscious beings until after Whirligig was hit by the mysterious phenomenon, two meteors, from opposite sides of space, hit precisely on the poles. People now believe this to be the work of gods, whoever they may be. The impacts set the planet on a spin, creating new conditions and bringing [[Mechanics#Magic|magic]] to the world at last.

A small bit of additional exposition, the history is separated into individual eras. Each era is marked by a notable, world changing event. 

### Era 0
Nothing notable happened other than the FORMATION OF THE PLANET, the world evolved as if it was normal. Small creatures and fauna roamed the globe and grazed on the normal grass and the normal vegetables. The coolest thing was probably some fossilized bug.

### Era 1
Era 1 begins with the dual impact. Magic begins to fill the globe, and creatures rapidly evolve. By the time people are finally brought to a proper conscious state, it has already taken most of its effect, leaving them thinking everything was normal. Civilization ran its course, invaded only by demons instead of plague and famine. The darkness present in the south drove everyone away, but from it came the monsters that kept humanity in check. Shortly after the instatement of the very first dam, keeping a pool of water from flowing away from the northern impact site, did era 2 begin.

### Era 2
Era 2 started with a massive rumbling, and a huge explosion of matter around the northern impact site. Where the buried meteor once was, was now a huge crater filled with water and a spire of truly massive proportions emerging from the center. Of course, to retain the whole duality thing these rocks have going on, the southern impact did that too. It only launched a few beasts where they shouldn't be though. This was DEVASTATING for existing colonies. While outer colonies were generally underdeveloped and low population, the amount of settlers drawn to the northern impact due to it's high resource yields resulted in a lot of destroyed infrastructure, and very many crushed spirits. This was a major setback at the time, but would soon prove to be a blessing.

### Era 3
This is where MAGIC is introduced! The winding of these spires as the tilted planet spun spooled magic and cast it into the globe. The very material the world was made of began to come alive with power and wonder. The forests grew whimsical and the creatures to match. A rapid growth in magical potential threw the creatures of the south into a riot. They attacked and attacked for years on end, developing supernatural ability, and wringing humanity out to it's final cities all the way north. It's an era of destruction and would truly spell doom for people as a species, if ERA 4 HADN'T TRANSPIRED!! WOOO!!!! YEAH!!! ERA 4 MY MAN!!

### Era 4
4 begins when the first person in history harnesses magic! It was crude and unrefined, hardly able to be controlled, but it was powerful. St. Peter (meta reference to the guardian of the pearly gates) was the first explorer to ever surmount the northern spire! After centuries of waiting, the gift at the top was claimed, and Peter was given the knowledge to perform magic, and the gift of living as long as there is a need for him to live. Peter is exceptionally strong, and despite the damage caused fighting back against the assault of the southern spire, humanity had prevailed. As magic was refined over hundreds of years, and Peter remained TOP DAWG to educate the population, it grew into groups of different magic users and uses. Industry was developing, and people reclaiming what was theirs long ago became a real possibility. Soon the central city had grown to cover a large portion of it's continent, and housed some of the most technologically advanced people around. The only shortcoming being WHOOO was gonna ENFORCE the LAW!! The people on top never get off their ass, and the people below forgot how to use their arts to defend themselves! If only there were some justice keeping foundation to keep society from killing itself!
### Era 5
THE GUILD SYSTEM! 2 guilds stood as the founding figures, and served as a prime example of anyone to join in the future; [[Guild Curse]], and [[Guild one]]. Corvus of Guild One Establishes the guild system headquarters in the south, and from then on expansion was way more possible for the layman. Two new groups, the wizards and the reporters, split off and inhabit new territory. Further technology differences ensue, and just a single digit number of years later the WHOLE WORLD is PEACEFUL and NOT BEING RAVAGED BY THE DEMONS. 

### Era 6
St. Peter, after educating the guild system and securing his secrets, finally passes on. The final word is spoken by him and he disappears. poof. all puff of smoke like. Some believe he ascended to godhood, others believe him to have dropped down dead like the rest of the people. Either way a new heir to the north needed to be chosen. Who will it be? I'm not telling you here go read Corvus' bio. The results of this are now major political unrest! BIG S.P. was keeping everyone calm and happy with his impenetrable presence. Now there's war between so many sects, and the previous tri-colonial people of whirligig are split and broken. Infrastructure is in shambles. Magic is pitted against technology. The reporters are there I guess?
