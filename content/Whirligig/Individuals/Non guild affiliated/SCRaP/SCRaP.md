"Scrap", standing for Standard Crud Repossession And Processing, is a group of adrenaline junkies that get their kicks with space scale urbex. The only people to have left the atmosphere, they're the go-to resource for anything you need to know about nearby moons and dried planets. The implications of the existence of these facilities you'd think would be enough to get them to stop and think, but next thing you know SCRaP is back already with a bunch of metal and junk. 

On top of their high tier exploration efforts, the machinery used is quite dated. A simple metallic box equipped with whatever thrusters they've collected throughout the years works as the escape mechanism, however the reason they're the only ones going to space is because of the incredible brains behind their operations. 

Their identities are anonymous, only outwardly showcasing themselves under old hazmat. 

Their base of operations shifts around the wilderness, as indicated by differing launch locations.
