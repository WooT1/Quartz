 Whirl is based on 3 unique factors,

  

-Your faction type (Spin / Charge)

-Your Meter

-Meter coefficient

  

Faction type only helps to determine playstyle. 

  

Spin is very consistent with meter usage. Meter usage with spin is likely to be alternating or comboing, and takes shape in 

  

Charge requires you to stockpile a lot of meter, in order to dump it out all at once in one very powerful move. Because of their low meter utilization this character can be very vulnerable early on in battle. 

  

Meter is the resource used to manage both Spin and Charge, characters can have various meter values but most cap out at 100% (save for some planned exceptions wink wink). Meter is taken in percentages, which are attributed to each move. The more percent a move takes it’ll be that much more useful.

  

Meter coefficient varies per combat, per turn, and is determined by a few factors. It is used to determine the meter gained per turn. It is important to note that you cannot gain meter with an attack that uses it. 

Factor 1) Action - Doing certain things during combat can increase or decrease your meter coefficient, eg. defending someone else (+) , making a close save (+), or using meter (-)

Factor 2) Inaction - If someone fails to do something in a turn their coefficient can decay. This does not happen during a discharge turn. 

Factor 3) Momentum/Static 

Momentum is a factor unique to Spin. Momentum will contribute positively to meter when chaining moves under or equal to 70% and contribute negatively after using moves over 70%. 

Static is a factor unique to Charge. Static will contribute positively based on the percent of enemies left in the encounter. This means that single enemy encounters and bosses will be done quickly, while larger events will have to be more planned out.

  

### Character options

Characters can be built how you would like to play. My objective here is to have super loose parameters and supply players with as much creative freedom during combat as possible. 

  

Roles determine, well, your role in the party. Each role has pros and cons but this further helps determine the playstyle of the character.  
Offense is the damage dealer. You have low healing ability, and low base defense, but you’ll be doing most of the damage. 

Defense is the shield of the group. A Defense character will likely have a higher base defense and agility, but low effective damage.

Non Combat Is pretty all encompassing. From information to buffs to healing if you’re not planning on taking hits OR dishing them out, Non Combat is for you. 

  
Secondary roles further nail down how you’ll be playing. These are customizable stat bonuses and can really be called whatever you want. 

Attributes are a second layer of stats that I figured were all encompassing enough to be something else. To apply attributes to a new character default all to base and apply 6 points. Applying 1 guts point uses 2 points.  
GUTS - Guts determines your base coefficient before combat. High guts results in a higher starting coefficient, and lower guts results in a lower coefficient. Base value is 1, and has a maximum of 6. 

Each point in guts is equal to 2.5 coefficient, leaving the max before combat to be 15.  
Role Value (RV) - This value is determined by your role, it’s used for primary rolls (rolls befitting of your character) and has a base of 5 and a maximum of 20. 

Primary rolls are done with d6+RV+proficiency, You also gain an additional d4 for every 5 RV you have. 

Secondary Value (SV) - SV has a base of 5 and increases by 0.6 every RV point and is a flat modifier to non focus rolls. It’s mostly just to keep your non focus abilities up. (don’t worry about the funny numbers I’ll be keeping track of everything for you)

There are a few pretty standard stats and they’re defined by proficiency and your role.

Attack - Offense focus 

Agility - Offense/Defense focus

Defense - Defense focus

Stealth - Defense/Non combat focus

Support - Non combat focus

Brains - Non combat/Offense focus

- What certain stats are used for will be defined in combat, and the default proficiency is 1. 

- Start with 6 secondary points and apply them to any stat you want. Apply an additional 3 focus points to your role focus.

- Secondary roles add an additional two focuses. Distribute two points between them. The additional focuses can be ones already decided through primary role.

- You can subtract points from a stat down to -2 to add them to other stats.

- Point total should add up to 17 for level 1

  

I also plan on implementing a trait system for events that would occur in battle for specific characters, as of now I’ll simply bring it up while creating your characters and manage it on the spot.
