and basically this super inspired me for king of nothing (Also stolen from ror2) as pretty much a guy cursed similar to lute where he keeps coming back, this time though it's also a little like link where there's a bajillion reincarnations working towards the same objective. In this case there would be different holders through history, one per generation or of they're stupid, more than one. I don't know who the current title holder will be but this is a big step in the correct direction for how I want to build.
